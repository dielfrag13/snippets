    # next discussion point: how does set conversion in python work?
    # it's implemented as a hash table under the hood. 
    # Q: "so what happens if the elements are unhashable?" (like if they were a list)
    # A: well, this would raise a TypeError.
    # Q: "so what do you do then?"
    # A: Well, we would have to convert the elements to a hashable type (like tuple)...
    #    or we could sort the elements and check for duplicates using python's 'in'. 
    #    That'd be O(n log n) time, as sorting in python is O(n log n). 

# this works great, but turns out, no need to convert the set back to the list
