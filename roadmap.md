ðŸš€ C++ Learning Roadmap for Your Trading Engine
1. Classes, Headers & Source Files

Concept: How classes are declared in headers and defined in .cpp files.

Practice: Write a Foo.hpp and Foo.cpp with a constructor, method, and destructor.

Engine tie-in: Engine, IStrategy, and IBroker live in headers; their implementations in .cpp.

2. Virtual Functions & Polymorphism

Concept: virtual methods and override let you call derived-class code through a base pointer.

Practice:

struct Base { virtual void speak() { std::cout << "Base\n"; } };
struct Child : Base { void speak() override { std::cout << "Child\n"; } };
Base* b = new Child(); b->speak(); // prints Child


Engine tie-in: IStrategy::on_price_tick is pure virtual; strategies override it.

3. Pure Virtuals & Abstract Interfaces

Concept: Declaring =0 makes a class abstract (canâ€™t be instantiated directly).

Practice: Make an IAnimal with virtual void sound()=0; and implement Dog.

Engine tie-in: IBroker, IStrategy, and IMarketData are abstract; you provide concrete classes.

4. Destructors & RAII

Concept: ~Class() cleans up resources; virtual ensures derived destructors run.

Practice: Log messages in ~Base and ~Derived to see order of destruction.

Engine tie-in: Deleting IBroker* that points to a NullBroker cleans up correctly.

5. References vs Pointers

Concept: & is a reference (always valid alias); * is a pointer (can be null).

Practice: Write a function void increment(int& x) and see it update the caller.

Engine tie-in: const PriceData& in on_price_tick avoids copying big structs.

6. Smart Pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)

Concept: RAII wrappers that manage memory automatically.

Practice: Replace new/delete with std::make_unique and watch it free on scope exit.

Engine tie-in: Engine owns std::unique_ptr<IStrategy> to enforce single ownership.

7. Function Objects & Lambdas

Concept: std::function can hold function pointers, lambdas, or functors.

Practice:

auto f = [](int x){ return x*2; };
std::function<int(int)> g = f;
std::cout << g(5); // prints 10


Engine tie-in: Brokers accept std::function<void(const PriceData&)> callbacks for ticks.

8. Templates & the STL

Concept: Generic programming with <T> and the Standard Template Library.

Practice: Use std::vector<int> and std::unordered_map<std::string,int>.

Engine tie-in: EventBus uses std::unordered_map<std::string,std::vector<Handler>>.

9. Event Bus / Pub-Sub

Concept: Decoupling via events: publishers emit, subscribers listen.

Practice: Implement a mini bus where multiple lambdas print messages.

Engine tie-in: Market data publishes Tick, strategies subscribe.

10. Multi-file Builds & CMake

Concept: How to organize code into targets and link them together.

Practice: Make a project with a library and an executable, link them.

Engine tie-in: Youâ€™re already using CMake for engine, support, adapters.

11. Networking & JSON (support layer)

Concept: Use libraries (cURL, WebSocket++, nlohmann/json).

Practice: Fetch a public API (https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json) and parse it.

Engine tie-in: Brokers and market-data providers live on REST/WebSocket APIs.

12. Threads & Concurrency (later, once comfy)

Concept: std::thread, std::async, mutexes.

Practice: Spawn a thread that prints numbers while main thread prints letters.

Engine tie-in: Market data streams â†’ run async; strategies â†’ event-driven.
